Steady-state was defined as the first local maximum dose (maximum of moving 4-week interval) of LY2605541 or glargine within the window of +/- 2 weeks. The number of dose adjustments to steady-state was the total number of dose changes until steady-state was reached. LS means were calculated using a MMRM with baseline insulin dose measurement, stratification factors (country, HbA1c, LDL-C \[\< 100 mg/dL and ≥ 100 mg/dL\], and SU/meglitinide use), treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects., Baseline to 52 weeks|European Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), The EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) using a 3-level scale of 1 to 3 (no problem, some problems, and extreme problems). These combinations of attributes are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United States population-based algorithm. Scores range from -0.11 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health.

Each item score ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The total SEITQ score is the sum of each item scores, with the range of 5 to 35. Higher SEITQ score indicates better outcome (higher self-efficacy). LS Mean was calculated using Mixed Models Analysis (MMRM) for repeated measures with all post-baseline SEITQ as responses, baseline SEITQ as a continuous covariate, treatment group, Visits, and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects and participant as a random effect., Baseline, 48 Weeks",

LS mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with variables Baseline + Baseline HbA1c Group (\<=8.5%, \>8.5%) + Pooled Country + Baseline OAM Use (Met, Met plus SGLT-2i) + Treatment + Time + Treatment\*Time (Type III sum of squares)., Baseline, Week 52|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Weight Loss ≥5%, Percentage of Participants who Achieved Weight Loss ≥5%, Week 52|Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction as Measured by the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, Change Version (DTSQc) Hyperglycemia, Hypoglycemia and Treatment Satisfaction Score, DTSQc, an 8-item questionnaire, assesses relative change in treatment satisfaction perceived frequency of hyperglycemia, and perceived frequency of hypoglycemia from baseline to week 52 or early termination.The treatment satisfaction score ranges from -18 to 18 where the higher the score the greater the improvement in satisfaction with treatment. The lower the score the greater the deterioration in satisfaction with treatment. The hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia scores range from -3 to 3 where negative scores indicate fewer problems with blood glucose levels and positive scores indicate more problems than before. LS mean was determined by ANCOVA model for endpoint measures: Variable = Baseline DTSQs + Pooled Country + Baseline HbA1c Group (\<=8.5%, \>8.5%) + Baseline OAM Use (Met, Met plus SGLT-2i) + Treatment (Type III sum of squares)., Week 52|Rate of Hypoglycemia With Blood Glucose <54 Milligram/Deciliter (mg/dL) [<3.0 (Millimole/Liter (mmol/L))] or Severe Hypoglycemia, The hypoglycemia events were defined by participant reported events with blood glucose \<54mg/dL (\<3.0 mmol/L) or severe hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an episode with severe cognitive impairment requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. The rate of postbaseline hypoglycemia was estimated by negative binomial model: Number of episodes = Pooled Country + Baseline OAM Use (Met, Met plus SGLT-2i) + Baseline HbA1c Group (\<=8.5%, \>8.5%) + Treatment, with log (exposure in days/365.25) as an offset variable., Baseline through Safety Follow-Up (Up to Week 56)",
